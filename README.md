# tylerTechNotes

is basically my personal notes app for my software support job at tyler-tech

mostly for my own usage of keeping various product specific notes, but also to learn
about setting up supabase on an sst project like this one

## dev initializer:

did a quick zsh script to pass the public key from clerk to sst secrets which itself
is passed to astro as an env variable ephemeral to the host machine

run with

```sh
/usr/bin/env zsh init_dev.sh
```
